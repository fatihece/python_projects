# Problem Statement
# Write a python code that finds the largest number among the n numbers given by the user as input.

# First, take n from the user, then take n numbers one by one and select-print the largest one.

# It is forbidden to use max() function.

# Indicate which computational thinking concepts have you used.


lst = []
num = int(input('How many numbers:  '))
for n in range(num):
    numbers = int(input())
    lst.append(numbers)
max = 0
for numbers in lst:
     if numbers > max:
         max = numbers
print("The largest number is:", max)
